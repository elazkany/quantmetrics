## 🔍 Project Overview

Quantmetrics is a Python package for option pricing and model calibration, offering a modular, extensible framework for conducting financial computations and numerical experiments. It leverages object-oriented programming to model Lévy processes and perform pricing using both established and novel methodologies.

> 🚧 This package is a work in progress. It currently supports a subset of models and European-style options, with future development planned for additional models, calibration techniques, and option types (e.g., American options).

## 🔬 Research Background

This package was developed as part of a research project on second-order Esscher pricing, conducted under the supervision of Prof. Tahir Choulli and in collaboration with Prof. Michèle Vanmaele. The project aimed to extend classical option pricing techniques and create a modular framework for testing and validating new methodologies.
